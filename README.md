===================

Finding similar music from an artist seed and making a Youtube playlist out of those similar artists

Summary<br>
This program currently takes a music artist seed, finds similar artists using the EchoNest API, and then prints out the best songs (currently a total of 3 for each artist) for each of the artists. 

Future goals<br>
I will initially display a link for each of the songs listed to a youtube video showing and playing the song. My long term goal is to create an embedded a youtube playlist on the page which contains all of the songs that were found.
